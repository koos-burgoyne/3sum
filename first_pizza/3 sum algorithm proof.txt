Given an ordered set of numbers, A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, where |A| = n, 

Finding the number of 3 values that sum to nought is equivalent to counting combinations of 3 without repetition. This means choosing 3 objects from A, choosing any particular value in any one counting only once.

If counting is ordered, the first combination is the first three values of A and the last combination is the last three values of A. For every combination in between, a pattern emerges:

Call the set of differences between each pair of values in the ordered set D: {a2-a1, a3-a2, ..., an-an-1}. |D| = n-1
Listing the sums of k values from A in columns according to their first value, this pattern emerges where the difference between every value in the first column and every adjacent value in the second column is equal to D1, the difference between every value in the second column and every adjacent value in the third column is equal to D2, and so on.

Similarly, in every column the set D emerges as a sequence when counting vertically through each column; because the second value in each 3 combination comes from A, if we count from the bottom of each column we observe a repeating pattern of Dn, Dn-1, ... that repeates in a quadratic pattern of (n choose 2) values.
